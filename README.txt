program requires PIL (python imaging library)
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/


use encoder to generate encoded picture

then use decoder to decode whatever was encoded



:^) i added (almost) every failsafe possible




known bugs:

using ascii character 178 will give false "encode" reading.
will completely kill program


image must be rectangular. no transparent layering
will completely kill program
